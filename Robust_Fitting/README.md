# Robust Fitting
*   In this section is implemented RANSAC and some of its variants (Msac and Lmeds). This algorithms will be used to fit different models of the same "kind" (Multi-Model fitting)

*   The file demo_robustmmf_script.m contains the main script while demo_robustmmf.mlx contains the same file as a live editor 

*   You can run the code on different set of points and number of outliers in order to check the robustness.
