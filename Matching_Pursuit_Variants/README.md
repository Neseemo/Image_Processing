# MP variants
Matching Pursuit is an algorithm that maximizes the sparsity of the representation of an input 's' with respect to a dictionary 'D'.
In this notebook some variants of the matching pursuit are presented:


*   Weak Matching Pursuit
*   Least Squared Matching Pursuit
*   Orthogonal Matching Pursuit
