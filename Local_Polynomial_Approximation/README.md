# Local Polynomial Approximation

This is a technique to fit a polynomial that approximates locally the behaviour of a function given some noisy observations in a certain window. 
The quality of the approximation depends both on the desired degree of the polynial and on the window dimension (increasing the number of observations the variance of the prediction decreases)
