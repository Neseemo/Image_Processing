# Image Deblurring
Here the aim is to deblur an image, i.e. to fix an image to which a particular filter has been applied (invert the convolution).
Assuming to know the filter initially applied to the image is a strong assumption, indeed it leads to a perfect reconstruction of the image through the inverse Fourier Transform.

In the second notebook another algorithm called wiener filter is presented.
