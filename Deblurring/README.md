# Image Deblurring
Here the aim is to deblur an image, i.e. to invert the a convolution of a filter.
Assuming to know the filter initially applied to the image is a strong assumption, indeed it leads to a perfect reconstruction of the image through the inverse Fourier Transform.

In the second notebook another algorithm called wiener filter is presented.
